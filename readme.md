Thank you for opening the OOP project
=========================================================================================================================
This project is a folder for all the deliverables provided during the Tuesday Deliverable at Sparta Global
When you open the folder, you will see 3 different projects that test my ability to follow OOP principles

Animals Java Class
=========================================================================================================================
The value of this exercise was to explore different concepts of OOP.
Encapsulation inheritence and polymorphism.
The idea of the project was to show how an animal can have many different forms and different child classes can inherit from
one parent. 

Device
==========================================================================================================================
This file explores the  possibilities provided by inheritence. I created 5 unique devices that are all child classes of the 
device class. The work was meant for me to practice inheritence using a concept of my own.

ATM Simulator
==========================================================================================================================
This file is in correspondence with the test file in the test folder.
Here is a class where an ATM takes input and updates itself according to the amount of a certain currency valuee that it 
has remaining. This was an open ended project provided by Sparta so I had to solve the problem while using the recently 
taught priinciples of OOP and SOLID. When you run the program, you will see how a user can put in a number and the 
result will be the ATM returning a number of notes. The value of whom will add to the sum specified by the input.
